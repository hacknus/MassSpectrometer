\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}
Mass-spectrometers are widely used in different fields to determine the compounds of unknown substances and/or to measure the quantities thereof. 
In our case the sample is ionised and then accelerated towards a detector. Between the ionisation and the detector a magnetic field is placed, which acts as a bandpass-filter and only lets a certain charge-to-mass ratio through. 
Another approach would be to measure the time-of-flight in order to determine the charge to mass ratio.\\
While our mass-spectrometer is large and thus stationary, there exist also portable machines. For example, the Swiss and US Armed Forces use portable mass-spectrometers to determine the compounds after a possible chemical attack. \cite{army}
